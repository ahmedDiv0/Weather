-_- Hello Every One
ðŸŒŸâ€” Iâ€™m excited to reveal my latest projectâ€” ðŸŒŸ 
It's about knowing you weather and using (API) to fetch data of the weather but 
I used to write React components in quite a different way . Instead of using functions and Hooks, I used classes and so-called lifecycle methods.
as we are know, you will most likely never have to write a class component but I might even need to convert class components to function components at some point. so I want to share this skill with you



I Used in this Project

-React.js

-JavaScript

-CSS
